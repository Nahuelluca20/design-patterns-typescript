# InterfaceSegregationPrinciple
The principle of interface segregation states that clients of a given program should only know about it those methods that they actually use, and not those that they don't need to use. The ISP applies to a large and complex interface to split it into smaller and more specific ones, in such a way that each client uses only the one they need, thus being able to ignore the rest.
